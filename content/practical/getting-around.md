Once in town, there are a variety of ways to get around quickly, safely and sustainably.

## <span style="color:Orange">Mass Transit</span>

{{< figure src="images/locations/MTD.png" alt="CU Mass Transit" >}}

The greater Champaign-Urbana area boasts one of the best public transportation systems in the country — the [Champaign Urbana Mass Transit District](https://mtd.org) (MTD) system. With over 50 years of service and a 98% customer satisfaction rate, it’s no surprise they have received the American Public Transit Association's Outstanding Achievement Award twice. Their efforts to "Go Green" in our community have resulted in a fleet that is 100% low to zero emissions. MTD’s low-emission hybrid buses operate on 50% less fuel than standard diesel, and their hydrogen fuel cell electric (HFC) buses are zero emission using renewable hydrogen. MTD goes a step further, exemplifying our community’s culture of innovation and technology, by generating hydrogen fuel on site with their own solar array powering the hydrogen fuel production station which makes their HFC fleet truly zero emission, from sun to street.

MTD service is easy to access for everyone — whether you need to bring your bike and use their bike racks, park-n-ride to an Illini Football game on the 280TranSport, or utilize assistive devices and mobility aids. And, better yet, a one-way trip is just $1 at the door, cash or via the Token Transit app, so you can affordably and sustainably get around Champaign-Urbana. Check out their routes and plan a trip online at [mtd.org](mtd.org). You may also call (217) 384-8188 to speak to a live representative anytime buses are in service.
